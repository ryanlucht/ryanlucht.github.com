**Hey you!**
------------

**Welcome to the new RyanLucht.com blog!**

What started as an attempt to install this bangin Bootstrap theme to my website become a full-day nerd-out, digging into things like GitHub, Jekyll, Markdown, and even Ruby for the first time. 

Now I'm super excited to share this new blog space with you, and I look forward to writing some posts in the near future. You can expect posts about the music industry, self-improvement, product reviews, and my adventures. 

If you're interested in learning more about my skills/specialities and work experience, checkout my homepage at [RyanLucht.com](http://ryanlucht.com) 

*thanks!*
